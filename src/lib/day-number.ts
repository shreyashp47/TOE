/**
 * Handing out today's order numbers, #0001 upwards (see ./order-number.ts for
 * the why).
 *
 * Two pieces, both independent of Firestore so they can be tested without it:
 *
 * - `assignInTransaction` is the body of one numbering transaction. The
 *   Firestore adapter runs it inside `runTransaction`; the demo store runs it
 *   against localStorage. It re-reads the order and stops if somebody else
 *   numbered it first, which is what makes two boards racing safe: Firestore
 *   retries the loser's transaction, the retry sees the number, and gives up.
 *   firestore.rules independently refuses any write that is not exactly
 *   `counter.next`, so even a buggy client cannot hand out a duplicate.
 *
 * - `createDayNumberAssigner` is what the staff board runs over its live list.
 *   One assignment in flight per device, oldest order first, backoff when a
 *   transaction fails, and a full stop after repeated permission errors so a
 *   board that the rules refuse does not loop on them.
